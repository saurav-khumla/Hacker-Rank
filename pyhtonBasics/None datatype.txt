print() returns None.
The print() function displays
text on the screen, but it doesn’t need to return anything into the variable.

Ex:
spam = print('Hello!')
Hello!
>>> None == spam
True



Python adds return None to the end of any function
definition with no return statement. This is similar to how a while or for
loop implicitly ends with a continue statement. Also, if you use a return statement
without a value (that is, just the return keyword by itself), then None is
returned.
