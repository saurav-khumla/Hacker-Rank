While indexes start at 0 and go up, you can also use negative integers for
the index. The integer value -1 refers to the last index in a list, the value -2
refers to the second-to-last index in a list, and so on.

spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam[-1]
'elephant'
>>>spam[3]
'elephant'


#Getting Sublists with Slices:

A slice is typed between square brackets,
like an index, but it has two integers separated by a colon.

spam[1:4] is a list with a slice (two integers).

>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam[0:4]
['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam[1:3]
['bat', 'rat']
>>> spam[0:-1]
['cat', 'bat', 'rat']
