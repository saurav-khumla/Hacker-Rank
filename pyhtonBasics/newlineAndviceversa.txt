print('Hello')
print('World')

o/p:
Hello
World


The two strings appear on separate lines because the print() function
automatically adds a newline character to the end of the string it is passed.
However, you can set the end keyword argument to change this to a different
string. For example, if the program were this:

print('Hello', end='')
print('World')

o/p:
HelloWorld
